  <h2>Early career</h2>
  <p>Harrison Mills and Clayton Knight met during their freshman year at Western Washington University. The two did not share the same educational interests. Knight studied physics and math while Mills studied graphic design.[12] They did not begin collaborating musically until their senior year in 2012.[13] As a child, Knight was classically trained in piano and later learned guitar.</p>

  <h2>Name</h2>
  <p>Odesza is a misspelling of the Hungarian spelling for the city of Odessa, Ukraine. The band's name, however is taken from the name of Mills' uncle's sunken vessel. Only his uncle and one other crew mate survived.[14] Since the spelling "Odessa" was already being used by a Scottish synth band, they instead chose to use a form of the Hungarian spelling, replacing the "ss" with "sz".[15] The correct spelling in Hungarian is: Odessza.

    Individually Mills is known as Catacombkid, and Knight is known as Beaches Beaches. In reference to how Mills got his nickname he says, "I got into Aesop Rock and he has a song called 'Catacomb Kids.' I thought it sounded cool."[12] On the other hand, Knight got his nickname when, "...I was high in my bedroom making music one day</p>
